This is a project demo page for an AI engineering bootcamp that showcases a complete full-stack AI platform called AI4WA. Here's what it contains:

Core Architecture
The project demonstrates a multi-component AI platform built with modern technologies:

Backend Components:

Platform Repository: Main backend logic and API services
Django Admin: Administrative interface for content management
Hasura Interface: GraphQL API layer for efficient data querying
Qdrant Interface: Vector database for AI/ML operations (likely for embeddings and similarity search)
Frontend:

React/Next.js UI: Separate frontend repository providing the user interface
Live Demo System
The platform is currently deployed with these accessible endpoints:

Frontend Demo: Live application interface with login functionality
Admin Panel: Django-based administrative interface
GraphQL Endpoint: Hasura-powered API for data operations
Vector Database: Qdrant instance for AI-powered search and recommendations
Educational Outcome
This appears to be a capstone project for the bootcamp where students:

Build a complete AI-powered platform from scratch
Implement both frontend and backend components
Integrate vector databases for AI functionality
Deploy the entire stack to production
The page mentions certificate issuance upon successful completion, making learning outcomes measurable and verifiable.

Technical Stack Alignment
For Azure ecosystem developers, this architecture translates well to Azure services:

Django → Azure App Service

which one is better of the two images ?

Edit

Evaluated images for training milestones, chose measurable approach.
6s

Image 1 is Superior for Training Supervision
Why Image 1 (Measurable Milestones) Wins
Image 1 directly addresses your core supervision need: visible and measurable learning outcomes

Assessment Clarity
Week-by-week progression enables immediate intervention when students struggle
Requirement mapping shows exactly which technical competencies are being developed
Measurable deliverables provide objective pass/fail criteria for each milestone
Supervision Efficiency
You can quickly assess bootcamp progress by asking:

"Did Module 1 team complete GeoJSON processing by Week 2?" (Yes/No)
"Can Module 2 demonstrate vector embeddings by Week 4?" (Measurable)
"Is the full system integrated by Week 8?" (Observable)
Why Image 2 Falls Short for Training
Image 2 shows technical architecture but lacks the assessment framework you need for student supervision.

No timeline visibility
No measurable checkpoints
Difficult to track individual/team progress
Missing learning outcome validation points
Training Recommendation
Use Image 1 as your primary supervision framework. It provides:

Clear assessment rubric for each 2-week sprint
Visible progress indicators for early intervention
Measurable competency validation for certification
Timeline accountability for bootcamp completion
Image 2 is useful for technical planning but Image 1 is essential for educational supervision.

For your Snowflake Cortex bootcamp supervision needs: Image 1 is the clear choice.

Image 2 is Superior for Module Design
Why Image 2 (High-Level Architecture) Wins for Module Design
Image 2 directly addresses your parallel development need: 4 independent teams working simultaneously

Module Separation Clarity
Clear boundaries between Data Ingestion → Vector Engine → Query API → Frontend UI
Defined interfaces showing how modules connect without overlap
Parallel development enablement - teams can work independently with clear handoff points
Student Team Organization
For your 4-team bootcamp structure:

Team 1: Owns Data Ingestion module completely
Team 2: Focuses on Vector Engine/Cortex integration
Team 3: Develops Query API independently
Team 4: Builds Frontend UI with mock data initially
Measurable Module Outcomes
Each module has distinct deliverables:

Module 1: "Snowflake tables populated with clean geospatial data"
Module 2: "Cortex embeddings generated with similarity search working"
Module 3: "REST API responding to natural language queries"
Module 4: "Interactive map displaying geological data"
Why Image 1 Falls Short for Module Design
Image 1 shows timeline progression but doesn't clearly separate which team owns what responsibilities.

Timeline-focused, not module-focused
Unclear ownership boundaries between teams
Difficult to assign specific students to specific modules
Training Supervision Advantage
Image 2 enables clear team accountability:

"Is Module 2 team delivering vector embeddings on schedule?"
"Can Module 3 demonstrate their API independently?"
"Which module team needs additional Snowflake Cortex training?"
For your 4-team parallel development approach: Image 2 is the clear choice.

For Your Bootcamp: Modular Architecture is Superior
Why Modular Wins for Student Training
Measurable Learning Outcome Visibility
yaml
Modular Approach:

- Single deployment pipeline = easier supervision
- Shared Snowflake database = unified data validation
- Clear module boundaries = individual team accountability
- Integrated testing = end-to-end validation possible

Microservice Approach:

- 4 separate deployments = complex supervision overhead
- Distributed data = difficult to validate consistency
- Network dependencies = harder to debug student issues
- Service discovery = additional complexity not core to AI learning
  Student Assessment Simplification
  python

# Modular Assessment (What you want)

def assess_student_progress(): # Single application to test
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/geological-query")

    # All modules validated in one test
    assert response.status_code == 200  # Module 3 working
    assert len(response.json()['sites']) > 0  # Module 1 data loaded
    assert 'embedding_similarity' in response.json()  # Module 2 AI working
    assert response.headers['content-type'] == 'application/json'  # Module 4 integration

    return "✅ All modules functional"

# Microservice Assessment (Complex supervision)

def assess_microservice_progress(): # Must test 4 separate services
auth_service = requests.get("http://auth-service:3001/health")
data_service = requests.get("http://data-service:3002/health")
ai_service = requests.get("http://ai-service:3003/health")
frontend_service = requests.get("http://frontend-service:3004/health")

    # Network debugging required for student issues
    # Service discovery configuration needed
    # 4x deployment complexity

Snowflake Cortex Learning Focus
Modular Architecture Advantages
Single Snowflake Connection: All teams learn unified data access patterns
Shared Cortex Functions: Teams can build on each other's implementations
Integrated Performance Testing: End-to-end Cortex optimization measurable
Cost Monitoring: Single Snowflake account for all student usage tracking
Microservice Architecture Complications
Distributed Cortex Access: Each service needs separate authentication
Data Consistency Issues: Vector embeddings scattered across services
Complex Monitoring: 4 different Cortex usage patterns to track
Higher Costs: Multiple Snowflake connections and data duplication
Recommendation for Your Bootcamp
Use Modular Monolithic Architecture
yaml
Training Benefits:
Supervision Simplicity: ✅ Single application to monitor

Strategized parallel development techniques for module interdependencies.
5s

Parallel Development Strategy with Module Dependencies
The Challenge: Linear Dependencies vs Parallel Development
The Problem: Your modules have clear dependencies (1→2→3→4), but you want 4 teams working simultaneously.

The Solution: Contract-First Development with Mock Interfaces

Week 1: Define Module Contracts & Interfaces
Establish Data Contracts Early
yaml

# Week 1 Deliverable: All teams agree on interfaces

Module 1 Output Contract:
table_name: "geological_data"
required_columns: - id: INTEGER PRIMARY KEY - geometry: GEOGRAPHY - metadata_text: STRING - mineral_type: STRING - location_name: STRING
performance_requirement: "<100ms query response"
data_volume: "10,000+ records"

Module 2 Output Contract:
embedding_function: "get_similarity_search(query_text: str) -> List[Dict]"
rag_function: "get_rag_response(query: str) -> str"
performance_requirement: "85% accuracy, <200ms response"

Module 3 Output Contract:
endpoints: - POST /api/geological-query - GET /api/search/{location} - POST /api/chat
response_format: "JSON with coordinates + metadata"
performance_requirement: "<200ms API response"
Create Mock Data & Interfaces (Week 1)
python

# Module 1 provides sample data immediately

# geological_sample_data.json - 100 realistic records

sample_data = [
{
"id": 1,
"geometry": "POINT(115.8605 -31.9505)", # Perth coordinates
"metadata_text": "Gold exploration site with high mineral content",
"mineral_type": "Gold",
"location_name": "Perth Hills"
},

# ... 99 more realistic WAMEX samples

]

# Module 2 creates mock AI functions

def mock_cortex_similarity_search(query: str): # Returns realistic geological results for development
return [{"site": "Kalgoorlie", "similarity": 0.89, "minerals": ["Gold"]}]

def mock_rag_response(query: str):
return f"Based on geological data, here are sites matching '{query}': ..."

# Module 3 provides API stubs

@app.post("/api/geological-query")
def mock_geological_query(query: dict):
return {"results": mock_cortex_similarity_search(query["text"])}

# Module 4 uses mock APIs for development

const mockApiResponse = {
results: [
{site: "Kalgoorlie", coordinates: [121.4664, -30.7493], minerals: ["Gold"]}

is it better to use internal api to format each module output ?

Edit

Evaluated internal APIs as superior module communication strategy.
7s

Yes! Internal APIs Are Superior for Bootcamp Rotation
You're absolutely right. Internal APIs for each module would be much better for your visible and measurable learning outcomes and student rotation process. Here's why:

Why Internal APIs Are Better for Bootcamp Supervision
Standardized Assessment Interface
python

# With Internal APIs - Easy to Test & Measure

def assess_any_student_module1(): # Same API test regardless of who implemented it
response = requests.get("http://localhost:3001/api/data/health")
assert response.status_code == 200

    data_quality = requests.get("http://localhost:3001/api/data/quality-metrics")
    assert data_quality.json()["quality_score"] >= 0.99

# vs. Direct Implementation - Hard to Test Consistently

def assess_chris_vs_daniel_module1(): # Chris might use pandas, Daniel might use polars # Different internal implementations = different test methods # Harder to measure consistently across rotations
Rotation-Friendly Architecture
Week 1: Chris builds Module 1 with PostgreSQL internally
Week 2: Jinwen takes over, switches to Snowflake internally
Other modules continue working because they use the same API endpoints
No integration breakage during student transitions
Clear Snowflake Cortex Learning Progression
python

# Module 2 Internal API - Measurable Cortex Competency

POST /api/ai/embed
{
"text": "geological sample data",
"model": "text-embedding-1024"
}

# Response shows student Cortex mastery regardless of internal implementation

GET /api/ai/similarity-search?query="gold mines"&top_k=5

# Measurable: 85% accuracy requirement, <500ms response time
